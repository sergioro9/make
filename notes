Instead of writing the configure script by hand, we need to create a
configure.ac file written in m4sh—a combination of m4 macros and POSIX
shell script—to describe what the configure script needs to do.

generates m4 enviroment for autotools to use:
    aclocal

translate configure.ac into configure:
    autoconf

translate Makefile.am into Makefile.in:
    automake

The Makefile contains all kinds of interesting targets, including one to
build a tarball of the project containing all of the files we need to
distribute:
    ./configure
    make dist

You can even test that the distribution tarball can be installed under a
variety of conditions:
    make distcheck

To summarize, on the maintainer's system:
    aclocal # Set up an m4 environment
    autoconf # Generate configure from configure.ac
    automake --add-missing # Generate Makefile.in from Makefile.am
    ./configure # Generate Makefile from Makefile.in
    make distcheck # Use Makefile to build and test a tarball to distribute

On the end-user's system:
    ./configure # Generate Makefile from Makefile.in
    make # Use Makefile to build the program
    make install # Use Makefile to install the program
